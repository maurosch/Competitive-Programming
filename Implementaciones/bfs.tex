Competitive programming combines two topics:
(1) the design of algorithms and (2) the implementation of algorithms.

The \key{design of algorithms} consists of problem solving
and mathematical thinking.
Skills for analyzing problems and solving them
creatively are needed.
An algorithm for solving a problem
has to be both correct and efficient,
and the core of the problem is often
about inventing an efficient algorithm.

\subsubsection*{Order of magnitude}


At the moment, the most popular programming
languages used in contests are C++, Python and Java.
For example, in Google Code Jam 2017,
among the best 3,000 participants,
79 \% used C++,
16 \% used Python and
8 \% used Java
Some participants also used several languages.

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // solution comes here
}
\end{lstlisting}
